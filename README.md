# educatree__mocktest_portal

<h4>Introduction</h4>
- Built a webapp which gives a platform to both teachers as well as students to enhance their productivity. Using this
app teachers can design their mock tests and all the students can access the tests by their student id. It has all the
required functionalities of a mock test portal along with two different UI (Admin and Normal).
